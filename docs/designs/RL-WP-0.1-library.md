    Rate Limit and Donation Plan
    For azielcorpuslibrary.net only

    RL-WP-0.1 (library scope) 9 September 2026 Author: Aziel Eliab / GodLock.AZ Status: local specification and cost
    plan for the Digital Library Worker. Origin: https://www.azielcorpuslibrary.net Evidence window:
    Cloudflare billable usage, 2–9 September 2026 (8 of 30 cycle days).


    0. Sentence
    This plan is for the library. Not godlock.uk. Not the software tabs. Not local ChainLock. Visitors can still search and
    open cards. Bots cannot walk every AZDOC key. The operator is uncapped.

    1. Scope
    In scope:

•         https://www.azielcorpuslibrary.net

•         /v1/search

•         record cards (AZDOC id, title, content_sha256, chain_tip, shelf)
•         the Worker KV that backs those cards
•         a Donate strip on the library origin

    Out of scope:

•         godlock.uk
•         azieleliab.com software tabs
•         aziel-runtime Worker CPU as a separate product
•         local chainlock.py vaults
•         PDF bytes (those stay on the object shelf; sync already does not pull PDFs)

    ChainLock library-sync is a client of /v1/search. After this plan it should hit one packed index, not 191 keys.

    2. What the bill said
    Observed 2–9 September 2026 on the Cloudflare account that serves the library:

•         Total cost: $142.26
•         Projected cycle: $533.47 (2 September – 1 October)
•         Average daily: $17.78
•         KV Read Operations: 271.91M — $131.00
•         KV List Operations: 1.33M — $5.00
•         KV Write Operations: 1.37M — $5.00
•         Workers CPU ms: 92.36M — $1.26
•         Workers Standard Requests: 1.42M — inside the 10M included

•         D1 rows read: 5.44B — inside the 25B included ($0)

    First 10 million KV reads per month are included, then $0.50 per million. $131 is 262 million billable reads. That
    matches 271.91M minus the included 10M.

    1.42 million requests / 271.91 million KV reads ≈ 191 KV operations per library request. People are not opening
    272 million pages. The library hot path is listing or getting too many keys per search or per record view.

    3. Claim
    One packed library index, edge cache on /v1/search and record cards, a per-visitor cap on the library Worker, and
    a server-side operator token cut billed KV reads without taking the shelf down.

    4. What it is not
•         Not a public Node Gate panel on the library.
•         Not an IP allow/block UI.
•         Not a deletion of AZDOC records.
•         Not a change to ChainLock’s offline library.jsonl shelf.
•         Not invented wallet addresses.
•         Not rate limits on GodLock or on the operator’s local runtime.

    5. Root cause on this origin
    Likely hot-path habits on the library Worker:

•         KV.list() of the AZDOC namespace on every search

•         one KV.get per hit instead of one packed search result
•         missing cacheTtl on card gets
•         scrapers walking /record/AZDOC-* and /v1/search?q= across the catalog
•         wrangler / dashboard list also bills

    D1 already serves 5.44 billion row reads inside the free included band. If search can run on D1 or on one cached
    JSON index, KV stops being the catalog.

    6. Plan, library only
    Step 1 — Pack the library index. One key library:index:v1: AZDOC id, title, shelf, content_sha256,
    chain_tip, updated ts. No PDF body. /v1/search filters that object in memory or in D1. KV.list() leaves the
    request path.

    Step 2 — Cache cards. KV.get(id, { cacheTtl: 3600 }) for a single record. Search responses:
    Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=120, stale-while-revalidate=3600. Repeat identical queries should
    not bill KV.

    Step 3 — Cap KV work per library request. At most 8 KV operations per invocation (index + one card + receipts).
    Over that: return packed hits and truncated. Do not walk the namespace.

    Step 4 — Per-visitor bucket on this hostname only. Visitor id = SHA-256 of CF-Connecting-IP plus optional
    cookie. Host match: azielcorpuslibrary.net only.

    Default:

•         30 search requests / minute
•         120 record views / hour
•         800 library requests / day

    Soft exceed: 429, Retry-After: 30, body is the last cached search page so the shelf still appears up. Hard isolate:
    SweepGate poison / scraper only. Quarantine. No merge into ChainLock STM.

    Step 5 — Operator exclude. Secret header or Cloudflare Access service token in server-side gate_config.json.
    Operator sync, ingest, and verify skip the bucket. Same token must not appear in the library UI.

    Step 6 — Cycle alert. Budget cap $80–$100 on this account so a catalog scrape cannot run to $533.

    Step 7 — Measure on this origin. Success: KV reads per library request from ~191 toward 1–2. /v1/search stays
    up. library-sync --query Q still returns AZDOC cards. Offline library.jsonl unchanged.

    7. What a limited visitor still gets
•         search within quota
•         last cached result page when soft-limited
•         record cards they already opened
•         PDF links as they exist today (no new PDF pull into KV)
•         ChainLock local shelf if they synced earlier

    They lose unbounded crawl of every AZDOC key.

    8. Donation tab on the library
    Static island on azielcorpuslibrary.net only for this paper.

•         No Worker. No KV.
•         Networks the operator already controls. Paste addresses at publish. This paper does not invent them.
•         Copy plus optional public-plane tx note.
•         No legal name. No home. No case narrative.

    The tab funds the cycle cap. It does not replace Steps 1–4.

    9. Wire on the library Worker
     frag → sweep → [library-bucket] → fold → static → packed index / card → emit

    Refuse: sweep-isolate | rate-soft | rate-hard | kv-cap. ChainLock clients treat rate-soft as “use local
    shelf.” Site-fail was already the point of library.jsonl.

 Library plan only. Do not copy these buckets onto GodLock or onto local ChainLock. Operator token stays off the
 page.
